1. Install python in your machine.
    -- Try to install Pyhton version 3 at least, because they comes with pip installed with it otherwise you may need to install pip seperately.

2. Installing Python bindings for Selenium. Use pip to install the selenium package.
    -- Type command:    pip install selenium

3. Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Based on your browser version choose your browser driver. Here are some
   useful links to get your browser driver.
   --  Chrome:	https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
   --  Firefox:	https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
   --  Edge:	https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/
   --  Safari:	https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10/

[If you don't want to use the driver then you can use selenium server also.]
